TODO
~~~~
- Death
- Fix player air usage algorithm to allow air to recharge if the ambient pressure is high enough
  - maybe a tri-state situation: depletion, steady state, recharge
- Entrance / Exit, if we're going to kill the player we should at least give them an escape route
- Level generation
- Player progress, maybe give the option to improve sensor range, air tank size etc. also how should the player "pay" for this?
- Additional cell types - maybe engines, computer, computer conduits etc.
